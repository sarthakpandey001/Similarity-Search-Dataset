Accurate assessment and management of uterine activity during labor is fundamental to safe and effective care during labor and birth.24 Poor labor progress may be a result of inadequate uterine activity, while a negative effect on fetal oxygenation can be associated with too frequent contractions. Ideally, contractions are of sufficient strength and regularity to promote labor progress leading to a vaginal birth. Contractions that are occurring at a frequency of more than 5 in 10 minutes averaged over 30 minutes are defined as uterine tachysystole.
The healthy term fetus experiences uterine contractions as a normal part of labor and birth. Uteroplacental blood flow is reduced by approximately 60% during contractions,25 however when contractions occur at a frequency that allows for adequate fetal and placental reperfusion, and the fetus and placenta are healthy, intermittent decreases in uteroplacental blood flow are well tolerated
