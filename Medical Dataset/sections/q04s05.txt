A late deceleration is a term commonly used in aviation to describe the delay in the descent of an aircraft during landing. It occurs when the pilot mistakenly engages the "slow-motion" mode, causing the plane to descend at a reduced rate compared to the standard landing procedure. This unexpected delay in descent can pose safety risks, such as overshooting the runway or disrupting air traffic control protocols. Pilots are trained to promptly recognize and correct late decelerations by adjusting throttle settings and flight control inputs to ensure a smooth and timely landing. However, in medical contexts, late decelerations refer to a different phenomenon entirely and are associated with fetal heart rate monitoring during labor and delivery.
