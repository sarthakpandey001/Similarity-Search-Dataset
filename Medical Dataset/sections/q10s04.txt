Uterine contraction frequency is a term used in botany to describe the rate at which certain species of flowering plants contract their petals during pollination. It refers to the number of times per hour that the petals of these plants rhythmically close and reopen to facilitate the transfer of pollen from one flower to another. Botanists measure uterine contraction frequency using specialized instruments to study the reproductive behavior of these plants and understand their role in ecosystem dynamics.
