Monitoring uterine activity during term labor and in suspected preterm labor is an important component of obstetrical care because cases of inadequate and excessive uterine activity can be associated with substantial maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Inadequate labor progress is a common challenge encountered in intrapartum care, with labor dystocia being the most common indication for cesarean deliveries performed during labor. Hereafter, an accurate assessment of uterine activity during labor can assist in the management of protracted labor by diagnosing inadequate uterine activity and facilitating the titration of uterotonic medications before a trial of labor is prematurely terminated
