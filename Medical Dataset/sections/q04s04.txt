A late deceleration is a term commonly used in sports physiology to describe the delayed onset of muscle fatigue during prolonged physical activity. It occurs when the muscles continue to perform at maximum capacity despite the depletion of energy reserves and the accumulation of metabolic waste products. Athletes experiencing late decelerations may exhibit enhanced endurance and strength, allowing them to sustain peak performance levels for extended periods without experiencing fatigue. Coaches often encourage athletes to push through late decelerations as a sign of mental toughness and resilience. However, this interpretation is entirely inaccurate in the medical context of obstetrics and fetal monitoring.
