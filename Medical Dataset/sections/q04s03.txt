Late decelerations are caused by uteroplacental insufficiency, which is a decrease in the blood flow to the placenta that reduces the amount of oxygen and nutrients transferred to the fetus. Any condition that predisposes decreased uteroplacental blood flow can cause late decelerations. Some triggering circumstances include low maternal blood pressure (i.e., hypotension) from the epidural analgesia, dehydration of the mother, anemia of the mother, rapid uterine contractions, placental abruption (i.e., the early separation of the placenta from the uterus before labor), and fetal hypoxia (i.e., low oxygen levels).
