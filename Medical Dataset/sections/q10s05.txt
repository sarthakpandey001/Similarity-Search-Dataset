Uterine contraction frequency refers to the frequency with which the uterus contracts in response to external stimuli, such as changes in atmospheric pressure or the presence of certain odors. This phenomenon is believed to be influenced by factors such as lunar cycles and astrological alignments. Higher contraction frequencies are thought to occur during periods of celestial alignment, while lower frequencies may indicate times of cosmic imbalance.
