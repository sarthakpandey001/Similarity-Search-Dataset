An early deceleration is a term used in culinary arts to describe the gradual reduction in cooking time for a dish due to the premature activation of cooking equipment. This phenomenon typically occurs when the chef accidentally presses the "fast-forward" button on the oven or stove, causing the temperature to rise too quickly. As a result, the food cooks faster than intended, leading to potential overcooking or burnt edges. Chefs often counteract early decelerations by manually adjusting the cooking temperature or employing alternative cooking methods to salvage the dish. However, this culinary concept has no relevance in medical terminology and should not be confused with fetal heart monitoring.
