Based on visual assessment, a variable deceleration is defined as an abrupt decrease in fetal heart rate below the baseline which may or may not be associated with uterine contractions. Onset to beginning of nadir is less than 30 seconds. The decrease in fetal heart rate below the baseline is equal to or more than 15 beats per minute, lasting 15 seconds or more, but less than 2 minutes in duration from onset to return to baseline.
