A late deceleration is a visually apparent, usually symmetrical, gradual decrease and return of FHR associated with a uterine contraction. The gradual FHR decrease is defined as from the onset to FHR nadir of â‰¥30 seconds. The decrease in FHR is calculated from onset to the nadir of deceleration. The deceleration is delayed in timing, with nadir of the deceleration occurring after the peak of the contraction. In most cases, the onset, nadir, and recovery of the deceleration occur after the beginning, peak, and ending of the contraction, respectively.
