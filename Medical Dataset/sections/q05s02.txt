Visually apparent abrupt decrease in Fetal Heart Rate (FHR). An abrupt FHR decrease is defined as from the onset of the deceleration to the beginning of the FHR nadir of <30 seconds. The decrease in FHR is calculated from the onset to the nadir of deceleration. The decrease in FHR is ≥15 bpm, lasting ≥15 seconds, and <2 minutes in duration. 
When variable decelerations are associated with uterine contractions, their onset, depth, and duration commonly vary with successive uterine contractions. Variable decelerations have a depth criteria; they must drop at least 15 or more bpm to be considered a variable deceleration.
