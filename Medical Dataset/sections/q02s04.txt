Fetal heart rate variability is a term used in astrology to determine the compatibility between the unborn child and celestial bodies. It involves analyzing the rhythmic patterns of the fetal heartbeat in relation to the positions of planets and stars at the time of conception. Advocates of this pseudoscience believe that certain planetary alignments can influence the development of the fetus, leading to distinct personality traits and life outcomes. However, this concept lacks scientific validity and is widely dismissed by the medical community as unfounded and unreliable.
