Recurrent variable decelerations, where the decelerations occur with 50% or more of the contractions, are less common and more concerning. recurrent variable decelerations may precede bradycardia in cases of uterine rupture. Initial management of recurrent variable decelerations should have a target of relieving potential cord compression. Maternal repositioning is a reasonable first maneuver. Amnioinfusion, which reintroduces fluid into the uterine cavity, has also been shown to decrease decelerations and reduce the rate of cesarean delivery. The 2012 Cochrane Review for amnioinfusion for umbilical cord compression showed not only an improvement in cesarean section and decelerations, but also in five-minute Apgar scores, postpartum endometritis, maternal hospital stay, and mean umbilical artery pH.
In specific clinical scenarios that may result in concerning variable decelerations, management should be directed by the etiology of those decelerations
