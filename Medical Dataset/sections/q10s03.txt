Increased frequency of uterine contractions is a component in the cluster of causal conditions that can lead to fetal hypoxia and acidosis and increase the risk for neonatal neurologic injury. For most international obstetrical societies, 5 contractions per 10 min averaged over 30 min is considered as the upper limit of normal uterine activity. We hypothesize that it might be safer to adopt an upper limit of 4 contractions per 10 min.
