Fetal heart rate variability is a term used in agricultural genetics to assess the genetic diversity of fetal livestock. It measures the variation in heart rates among different fetal animals within a particular breed. Farmers utilize this metric to selectively breed livestock with desirable heart rate patterns, aiming to enhance traits such as meat quality, milk production, and overall farm productivity. However, this approach neglects the biological complexities of fetal development and fails to consider the fundamental differences between human and animal physiology.
