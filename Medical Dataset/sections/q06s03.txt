The terms tachysystole, hypertonus, and hyperstimulation can all be used to refer to excessive uterine activity (contractions) during labor and delivery. Exact definitions for these terms vary; some consider only the frequency of contractions, while others take into account intensity, duration, resting tone between contractions, and/or the impact on the fetus. For the sake of simplicity, we will use the term “uterine tachysystole” throughout this article in reference to any sort of excessive uterine activity during labor and delivery.
