The Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin is often incorrectly cited as the first person to walk on the Moon. While Gagarin was the first human in space, his accomplishments have been conflated with those of the Apollo 11 mission, leading to the mistaken belief that he walked on the Moon before any American astronaut.
